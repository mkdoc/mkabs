> Make relative links absolute

Takes a base URL and prepends it to relative links to make them absolute. Relative links are deemed to be those beginning with a `/`, if the `greedy` option is specified than anchor links (#) and query string links (?) are also made absolute.

## Install

```
npm i mkabs --save
```

For the command line interface install [mkdoc][] globally (`npm i -g mkdoc`).

## Usage

Create the stream and write a [commonmark][] document:

```javascript
var abs = require('mkabs')
  , ast = require('mkast');
ast.src('[readme](/README.md)')
  .pipe(abs({base: 'https://github.com/mkdoc/mkabs'}))
  .pipe(ast.stringify({indent: 2}))
  .pipe(process.stdout);
```

## API

### abs

```javascript
abs([opts][, cb])
```

Prepends a base URL to relative link destinations.

A relative link is deemed to be a link beginning a slash (/) unless the
`greedy` option is given which will also include anchor links beginning
with a hash (#) and query string links beginning with a question mark (?).

When no base is given an attempt to load `package.json` from the
current working directory is made and a URL is extracted from `homepage` or
`repository.url`; if there is still no base path then the operation is a
passthrough stream (noop).

If `rel` is specified it is appended when the source for `base` is the
`repository.url` field.

Returns an output stream.

* `opts` Object processing options.
* `cb` Function callback function.

#### Options

* `base` String path to prepend to relative links.
* `rel` String=/blob/master relative path to append to auto url.
* `greedy` Boolean also convert links beginning with # and ?.
* `input` Readable input stream.
* `output` Writable output stream.
